**Title: Spatially and functionally distinct subclasses of breast cancer-associated Ô¨Åbroblasts revealed by single cell RNA sequencing**

1_QC.R
2_Processing.R
3_Dimensionality_reduction.R
4_Differential_gene_expression.R
5_Plotting.R

Files with data required for the analysis: SS2_15_0048.tar.gz, SS2_15_0049.tar.gz, qc.tar.gz, 170210_naba_matrisome.txt

The working directory in R should contain all data files.
